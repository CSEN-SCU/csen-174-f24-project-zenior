            overview: "IoTsolate uses virtual local area network (VLAN) micro-segmentation to identify,isolate, and neutralize security risks in IoT devices. These devices have limited processing capabilities, diverse designs, and long lifespans, so they lack adequate shielding from attacks. IoTsolate prevents compromised devices from communicating with others, protecting unaffected devices on the network.",

            overview: "With a wide range of applications and the rise of cyberattacks, securing MCUs has become imperative; however, ensuring MCU performance is also crucial given how interconnected todayâ€™s systems are. This project examines the security and performance of next-generation microcontroller units (MCUs) leveraging new security solutions for IoT edge applications. By benchmarking these MCUs against key performance metrics, their viability will be assessed to facilitate the widespread adoption of this new firmware.",
